The Client was the owner of DrivePass Liam. The systems he wanted designed was a web-based program for education testing and lessions for driving.
I did the UML very well and was able to make the overall model reflect the program to work well. 
If i was to revise any particular part for the project it would be the power point presentation because I would want it to be better to understand and visulize the work that was put into the overall presintation. 
I interpreted the needs of the user by looking through what the client wanted the program to overall do and what the end product could look like. We need to consider the users needs when designing it because while the client is the one wanting the program made the it is the user that will be using the program. If they wont use the program than who will?
I approach software design from the beginning and asking questions from the point I would touch the program. I start with how will it look? What does it do? and how do I know it does this? The strategies I would use to analyze and design software is the structural models in order to understand what the big picture is overall.
